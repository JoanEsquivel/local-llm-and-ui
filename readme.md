```

## Instructions to run it in Mac OS
1. Install the ollama library
``` brew install ollama ```
2. Start the service
``` brew services start ollama ```
3. Install the model you want
- Look for the model you want to install locally at the website https://ollama.com/search
- How to install it? I want to try "deepseek-r1:8b"
``` ollama run deepseek-r1:8b ```

5. Is there a good UI tool to interact with the model?
- Check this tool: https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui 
- ``` pip install open-webui ```
- Note: you need Python 3.11 for this tool
- ``` open-webui serve ```
- Visit the website: http://localhost:8080/

6. But also, we can interact with the local LLM just by API requests saba
- Let me work with Jupyter for this demo. If yoy need to set up this for cursor please check this [Setup Jupyter in Cursor video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSfeBIBzr0)
- Access to your IDE plugins and look for Jupyter
- Let's create a file with the extension .ipynb. For instance my test.ipvyn.
